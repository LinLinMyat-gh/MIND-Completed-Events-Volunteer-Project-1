# Mentoring in New Dimensions (MIND) Event Analysis

This project aimed to analyze event registration and feedback trends for Mentoring in New Dimensions (MIND) to better understand participant demographics, preferences, and feedback. The analysis featured two key dashboards: Registration Trends and Feedback Trends, providing actionable insights to improve the effectiveness of MINDâ€™s events and enhance future engagement.



## Objectives

**Event Registration Dashboard**  
1. Determine the most frequent activities or motivations driving participant registration.  
2. Highlight participants who consistently register for multiple events to identify highly engaged individuals.  
3. Analyze peak registration times and popular event types to guide future planning.  

**Event Feedback Dashboard**  
1. Identify participants providing the most detailed or frequent feedback to recognize valuable contributors.  
2. Highlight the most common themes in participant suggestions for improving event quality.  
3. Track participant satisfaction trends to understand the key drivers of positive feedback and rejoining likelihood.  



## Data Description

These datasets cover a period from August to October, enabling the analysis of trends over time. It will support the evaluation of the consistency and evolution of participant engagement throughout the three months.  

**1. Registration Dataset**: includes attributes such as event name, participant details (name, age, gender, occupation), registration and event dates, age group, reasons for attending, and any questions for the speaker. This data will provide insights into participant demographics, motivations, and registration trends, helping to identify patterns in event interest and engagement.  

**2. Feedback Dataset**: contains information about webinar ratings, speaker ratings, comments for speakers, event suggestions, and future event interest, along with specific feedback directed at event content and facilitators. This dataset will help assess overall event success, participant satisfaction, and areas for improvement. It will also guide future event planning by highlighting interests and trends in feedback across different months (August to October).  



## Executive Summary

The "Mentoring in New Dimensions" (MIND) initiative aimed to analyze event registration and feedback trends to gain a deeper understanding of participant demographics, preferences, and satisfaction. As a volunteer data analyst, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of data collected from August to October. The study focused on identifying patterns in participant registration and feedback to derive actionable insights for enhancing event effectiveness and engagement.

## Conclusion: Strategic Focus

MIND should focus on expanding its audience beyond students under **20** by tailoring events for older participants and professionals. High-demand topics like soft skills, career preparation, and education should remain priorities, while addressing feedback on event quality and engagement. Hosting key events in peak months like **September** and implementing retention strategies, such as certifications and follow-ups, will enhance participation and loyalty. These steps will ensure MIND delivers impactful and relevant mentoring initiatives.  



## Recommendations
